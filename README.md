# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

As web development student, I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex so that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I open the tutorial, then I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
- When I click on the links in the table of contents, then I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
- When I read through each section of the tutorial, then I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
- When I reach the end of the tutorial, then I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
